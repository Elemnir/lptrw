# Learn Python the Right Way - Exercise 01

## Your First Program

The first program you ever write should be the Hello World. It is a program that prints the phrase "Hello World" and exits. In Python, this is done like so:

    from __future__ import print_function

    print("Hello World")

Copy this text into a file called `ex01.py` and run it from the command line using `python ex01.py`. 

The first line is what is called a module import, it is used to bring external features into the program. The feature it included in this case replaced the Python keyword `print` with a function of the same name. The reason for this has to do with the differences between Python2 and Python3, and will be explained in a later exercise.

The second line is called a function call. Functions take parameters and perform some computation on them. In this case, the function `print()` is called, and passed the string `"Hello World"`, which it then prints.

## Drills

* Try making the program print something else by changing the words between the `""` double quotes.
* Search for `python print function` and locate the Python documentation on the Web. What other parameters can it take? You don't have to understand them yet, just keep a mental note of how you found this information.
* Try calling print() multiple times within the program, this can be done by having multiple lines of `print("Something")`. Notice that you can change the strings for each separate call to print.
